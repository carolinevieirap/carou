# My Portfolio
A way to build a portfolio for free using Notion and Vercel.

## Intro

This repo is used to power my product design portfolio.


## About the repo / License
It uses Notion as a CMS, fetching content from Notion and then uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) to render everything, based on the [project built by Travis Fischer](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit). The site is then deployed to [Vercel](http://vercel.com).
